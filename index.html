			<h2>Our Cafe</h2>
			<p>In 2015 we opened a small working space where we could develop our idea to build a roaster.  We purchased an espresso machine and tried to make some seating so that we could occasionally serve a cup of coffee to any GUEST â€“ we were hoping this would cover the electric billâ€¦</p>
			<p>As it turned out, we were visited by so many incredible people on a daily basis and eventually this thing grew into one of Wroclawâ€™s small coffee houses.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, after trying many different ways, we were forbidden from roasting INSIDE the cafe because the damn neighbor upstairs wasnâ€™t too thrilled about getting smoked out on a daily basis, so we decided to relocate by the end of June 2017 â€“ exactly two years after opening our doors.</p>
			<p>FORTUNATELY we found a great place to roast while looking for another cafÃ©, this was at EkoBazaar (a local farmers market) in Wroclaw.</p>

			<h2>Our Company</h2>
			<p>With a lot of help, we built a roaster from scratch and began roasting our own beans within a little over a year of opening.</p>
			<p>We roast fresh coffee on a daily basis for our Guests and Clients â€“ this is our lifeblood.</p>
			<p>We also make customized Coffee Drippers for use at home, cafes, bars, restaurants, hotels, or even for offices.</p>
			<p>Last but not least, in the summer of 2016, we began production of Nitro Coffee on a medium size scale.  With a capacity of 180 liters a day, we supplied not only our cafe, two other cafes, but also a major IT company with a branch operating out of Wroclaw.</p>
			<p>As time goes on, we work to improve and possibly expand on our products and services.</p>
